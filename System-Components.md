## DPN's architecture comprises:
- individual preservation repositories (5 nodes in the initial network) 
- a distributed messaging system using AMQP for signaling among nodes
- a distributed registry for recording object location, fixity
- an identifier scheme for asserting and tracking the identity of content in the Network 
- common packaging scheme for wrapping content for exchange among nodes
- common transport mechanisms for exchanging content among nodes
- an encryption framework, to enable encryption and decryption of content at rest, consistent with DPN's security and agreements framework
- audit processes for ensuring fixity of packages
- a reporting infrastructure
