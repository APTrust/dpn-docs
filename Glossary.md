##Administrative Node: 
- The
node which serves as the primary contact with the depositor and holds
responsibility for the consistency of registry entries. The
administrative node holds a contractual relationship with the Depositor.
Only the Administrative node can make updates to the DPN registry entry
for content. 

##Administrative Restoration<span class="c0">:  In
the advent of a failure or withdrawal of an Administrative Node, another
DPN node will work with the owners of particular DPN content to ensure
they can gain access to the preservation package.

Stewardship of content owned by the exiting node is assigned
elsewhere to make content available back to the depositor.

##Auditing- Demonstrating that
DPN is providing the preservation services it has contracted to provide
for DPN Members. Auditing will be done at several different levels,
including object management, preservation actions and
infrastructure.

##Bag
- An individual
preservation item stored in BagIt format (see below).

##BagIt: 
- A "hierarchical file
packaging format designed to support disk-based storage and network
transfer of arbitrary digital content."  DPN uses this format for the
storage of digital objects, ensuring the integrity of each preserved
object for durability. [more

##Checksum: 
- Also called a
hash, a checksum is a randomly generated piece of data that is used to
verify the fixity of a digital object (see below). It is most commonly
used to detect whether a digital object has changed over time.

##Content Bag: 
- The basic unit
of storage in the DPN preservation environment. A content bag has member
content objects and metadata stored in BagIt format.

##Darkive: 
- A term used in some
DPN materials as a short form of ‘dark archive’.

##Deaccession: 
- The process by
which DPN permanently removes deposited objects from the DPN federation.
Deaccessioned objects are no longer accessible or recoverable from the
DPN nodes.

##Depositor:  
- An institution or
organization working directly with an
individual DPN Node to negotiate contracts, determine service levels,
and deposit materials into DPN via the Ingest  Node (see below). 

##DPN Charter Member:  
- An
institution or organization contributing financially to establish and
support DPN prior to June 30, 2013 (<span class="c7">[current
members](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.dpn.org/members/&sa=D&ust=1469578715626000&usg=AFQjCNEGTs8IyQdUvf8I7G_IOSg7Z96XgQ).  
Initial DPN Depositors must all be Charter
Members.

##DPN Digital Object: AKA
First Class Digital Object.

##DPN Node: Content is held in
DPN at nodes. These are individual organizations and institutions that
provide storage and preservation actions for DPN Depositors. DPN will
replicate the content from the Ingest Node (see below) to other DPN
Nodes, also known as Replicating Nodes.

##Federation##: 
- The DPN administrative organization and all of the Ingest,
Administrative, and Replicating nodes

##First Class Digital Object: 
- A DPN Digital Object that is audited and its integrity is
maintained.  A First Class Object may contain Second Class object(s).
Second Class objects are not individually audited. A first class object
is one that has an identity independent of any other item. The identity
allows the item to persist, and allows other items to claim
relationships with the item. A DPN content bag is considered a First
Class Digital Object and is tracked via a registry entry.

##First Node: (obsoleted) 
- See
Ingest Node and Administrative Node

##Fixity: Checking the fixity
of a digital object is the process of verifying that it has not been
changed or corrupted.

##In-Scope Services: A range
of services provided under contract to DPN in support of member data
preservation. This includes: preservation of ingested content (ingest,
bit level assurance of fixity, event monitoring, inventory reporting),
replication services, registry services - including consistency and
synchronization, and general system and service availability and
customer response. Further definition is provided in section 5.1 of the
SLA.  

##Ingest Node: DPN Depositors
will work directly with one or more DPN Nodes to negotiate contracts,
determine service levels, and deposit materials. This node is known as
the "Ingest Node" at deposit and “Administrative Node”
afterwards.

##Interpretive Bag: Contains
information, provided by the depositor, intended to provide context and
instructions to interpret the content bag. 

##Ingestion: The process of
bringing DPN Depositor content into the network. Ingestion happens via a
DPN Ingest Node.

##Package:  Organizing and
grouping content into discrete units, particularly for storage and data
transfer. DPN will be using Bags as an organizational unit. (See "Bag"
above.)

##Recovery: (See ‘Restoration’
and ‘Administrative Restoration.’)

<span class="c0 c20">In the DPN context, recovery applies to two
contexts:

1.  <span class="c20 c0">an Ingest Node loses a copy of its own content,
    or determines that it is partially or fully corrupt.
2.  <span class="c0 c24">a Replication Node loses its copy of content
    held for an Ingest Node, or determines that it is partially of
    fully corrupt.

##Registry: DPN will maintain
a registry of replicated content to allow management of Digital Objects
in the DPN network. It will track the identity, source, location of
copies, previous version, legal agreements, and fixity of content in
DPN. 

##Replicating Node: DPN will
replicate the content from the Ingest Node (see above) to other DPN
Nodes, known as Replicating Nodes. Content in Replicating Nodes will be
held “dark”, and inaccessible except for preservation actions. 

##Restoration: The act of
returning content to the depositor.


##Rights Bag: Contains
information, provided by the depositor, intended to document and assist
interpretation of rights associated with objects in a content
bag.



##Second Class Digital Object: 
- An
object contained within a First Class Digital object (content Bag).
Second Class objects are not individually audited or cataloged within
the DPN architecture. They are retrievable only via the content bag in
which they reside.


##SLA: Service Level Agreement.
- A contract between a service provider (DPN
or Node) and the service consumer (DPN or Member) that defines the level
of service expected from the service provider. SLAs are output-based in
that their purpose is specifically to define what the customer will
receive. 
They commonly include a definition
of: services, performance measurement, problem management, customer
duties, warranties, disaster recovery, and provisions for termination of
agreement.

##Succession:  As a
preservation network for the academy and by the academy, content
preserved in DPN will be covered by succession rights that will allow
the content to be used in the future by the academy after the
dissolution of the source of the content. The current model for
succession is via “Quit Claim”. 

##TDR (Trustworthy Digital
Repository):  A repository certified as meeting TRAC
requirements.

##TRAC (Trusted Digital
Repositories and Audit Checklist):  
- A checklist of best practices for
Trusted Digital Repositories built on the recommendations for TDR.

detailed in the SLA with DPN.
